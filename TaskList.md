  💡 KEY TAKEAWAYS

  ✅ What's Working Well:
  - Beautiful, polished UI/UX
  - Innovative swipeable message interface with AI
  - Complete onboarding flow
  - Solid settings and profile management
  - AI integration is functional and impressive

  ❌ What's Critically Missing:
  - No real backend or authentication
  - No real-time messaging infrastructure
  - No actual matching algorithm
  - No payment processing
  - No push notifications

  🎯 To Launch an MVP, You Need:
  1. Firebase/Supabase backend setup
  2. User authentication (Sign in with Apple)
  3. Real-time messaging (Firebase Realtime DB or Socket.IO)
  4. Basic matching algorithm
  5. Push notifications
  6. API key security (Keychain)
  7. StoreKit 2 for subscriptions

  Current State: The app is a beautiful proof-of-concept with excellent UI/UX, but needs
  significant backend work to become a functional product.
